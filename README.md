Part of bachalor thesis: Comparing Strategic Agents for Dominance:

Dominance is an area-control board game played on a checkered seven by seven board. Players have to spawn their pieces onto the board while trying to exert dominance over the game board. As the game processes pieces will be spawned, moved, and attacked. Dominance can be exerted if the opposing player can no longer exert dominance or is no longer able to perform a move.
In this paper we compare and improve different stategic agents for Dominance. The agents we will discuss are (Parameterized) Random, (Parameterized) Monte Carlo, Nega-max and Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our Nega-max agent uses a heuristic function and our Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo Tree Search agents use random game sampling.
By comparing these agents and using information about the game, we hope to find ways to easily improve the win rates of these agents while trying to find which agent performs the best for Dominance.
